# ngwallet-dart

`ngwallet (dart version)` is an ONLINE simple cli wallet to NGIN network.

So before running ngwallet, it is required to host or find a living rpc server on ngcore daemon.

## Usage

```bash
# run like javascript
dart ./bin/ngwallet.dart --help

# or use the binary
./ngwallet --help

```

You may get inconvenience during directly use becasue dartlang's cli support is so weak, but this is also the backend of **hawkhover**, the GUI wallet to NGIN, so developing on dart is meaningful.
