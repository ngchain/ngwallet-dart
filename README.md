# ngwallet-dart

a simple cli wallet to NGIN

## Usage

```bash
# compile
dart2native ./bin/ngwallet.dart

# get help
./bin/ngwallet help

```

You may get inconvenience during directly use becasue dartlang's cli support is so weak, but this is also the backend of **hawkhover**, the GUI wallet to NGIN, so developing on dart is meaningful.
